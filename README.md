EventPilot automates corporate event planning from weeks/months to minutes using a multi-agent system. Clients call our voice agent to describe their event; the system then passes information to our Tavily web scraping agent, who finds the best venues for client’s needs. These venues are passed to our negotiation voice agent that calls each venue and negotiates for the best price (potentially securing 10–15% savings). Finally, our system delivers curated research and negotiation results via SMS automatically, to the customer. Built with Vapi, OpenAI, MongoDB, and Tavily, EventPilot saves weeks to months of research and back and forth communication for enterprise operations teams. All through 1 simple phone call. MongoDB is used as agent context engine.
